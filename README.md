# Visualisation_Component_1

This project is component 1 of my course Visualisation. In this component, I have chosen a flight dataset from Kaggle (links in the pdf) and have performed a thorough Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on it, finding results from them and making conclusions. The entire project has been initiated in R Markdown, using libraries such as ggplot2, dplyr, tidy, and knit. During the process, I took help from the internet, my colleagues, referred books, and my professor's lecture notes, all of which were very helpful for me. The second component of this project will involve making an R Shiny app on the same dataset, which will be uploaded soon.
